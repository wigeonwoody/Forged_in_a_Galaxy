# The Force
### Path
Force powers are the manifestations of a Force-sensitive being's connection with the Force, an energy field that surrounds and binds together everything in existence. The nature and practice of such abilities are usually taught to learners by experienced practitioners, such as the Jedi and the Sith. Some techniques require a deep connection with either the light side or the dark side of the Force, but many are not specific to either affinity. The Force are practiced as a form of magic by some groups, such as the Witches of Dathomir, Nighsisters, Mind-witches, and users of Sith magic and Sith alchemy. Force powers can be used to levitate object, calm animals, and sense others' feelings.

- [x] You draw upon the Force to help you recover from injuries, gain special insight and other remarkable acts. When you rest and meditate to gather the Force, roll +spirit. On a **strong hit**, take up to +3 Force. On a **weak hit**, take +2. On a **miss**, take +2 Force but [[Endure_Harm]] (-2). Your max Force is +5. When you make moves aided by the Force, add +2 and suffer -1 Force.

- [ ] When you [Endure Harm](Moves/suffer/endure_harm) and score a strong hit with a match, you may instead ignore the harm and take +Force equal to the amount of harm faced (+1, +2, or +3).

- [ ] When you have at least +3 Force, you may [Gain Ground](Moves/combat/gain_ground) or [Strike](Moves/combat/strike) by unleashing hell. If you do, take an automatic strong hit and mark progress. Then, set your Force to 0.
